## [Module Ocean Model (MOM6)](http://github.com/CommerceGov/noaa-gfdl-mom6)

MOM6 is the sixth generation of the Modular Ocean Model under
development by scientists at at NOAA/GFDL, in collaboration with
scientists worldwide. MOM is a numerical ocean model for studying
ocean circulation, the climate of the ocean and ocean
biogeochemistry. The previous versions, upto and including MOM5, have
been widely used throughout the ocean and climate community, as well
as by NOAA, and applied in a wide range of applications. MOM6 differs
from the previous renditions by use of a general vertical coordinate
formulation and the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian method, features
that were tested in the GOLD layered model.
